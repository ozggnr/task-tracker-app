TaskerApp is a web-based application that allows users to create tasks and subtasks with specific dates and times. The application is hosted on [Render](https://render.com/) as a cloud service, making it easily accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.

## Features

-   Create tasks and subtasks
-   Set due dates and times for tasks
-   Mark tasks as completed
-   View color-coded status of tasks for previous days (incompleted, completed)
-   See progress bar for tasks

## Usage

To use TaskerApp, you can visit:

Once there, you will be presented with the TaskerApp homepage. From here, you can create new tasks and subtasks, mark tasks as completed, and view the status and progress of your tasks. When the time has come your task status will change to 'In Progress' automatically.
